Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company that develops financial plans for their clients including their savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. As a result the comapny handles a like of discrete information for their clients. The goal of the project was to modernmize their software security with a file verification step to their web application.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Identifying secure ciphers and encryptions for the client was the best part of the project. Secure code is the foundation for software security, and thus is the most impactful way for developers to secure a company's software assets. Without software security, a company is highly vulnerable to attacks that can both impact them directly financially, as well as cause a loss of trust in their clients' data security.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Initially understanding the chart of the Vulnerability Assessment was very difficult, as I didn't really have information to contextualize what each area of the assessment chart was referring to. For example I didn't even really understand what a cipher was.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To increase layers of security we both identified an encryption, as well as a cipher. In addition, we performed statis Maven testing for the provided program to identify vulnerable dependencies. The testing seemed very powerful at identifying areas of risk in software and would be good to use in the future.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

When refactoring the code, I ran the Maven vulnerability assessment to determine what vulnerabilities existed prior to refactoring, and what ones existed after refactoring. This allows one to determine if the refactoring process introduced more, or reduced vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

As always, Stack Overflow is an incredible resource when unrecognizable errors appear and I'm not familiar enough to know what to do with them. The website was very useful at multiple stages of this course.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I was very happy with how my code was organized in these assignments, as well as my understanding of creating a certificate, so I think these would be great to share.
